## About Me
<p style='text-align: justify;'> Hello there!ðŸ‘‹ I'm a computer science graduate student from the University of Houston, armed with a Bachelors degree in Information Technology. I love solving problems and writing code. I've spent some quality time as a Senior Software Engineer at Capgemini, where I've navigated the realms of software development with zeal and finesse.  Currently on the lookout for exciting opportunities, I'm eager to collaborate with a team where creativity meets functionality. Let's build something awesome together â€“ one line of code at a time! </p>
